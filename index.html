      Introduction
    </h3>

    <h4 class="head">
      Inspiration
    </h4>
  
    <p class="main"> 
      The idea for this website arose because I like trying different cuisines. 
      However, I would go to these restaurants and have no idea what I was doing. 
      An obvious solution to this might be to ask someone for information, 
      perhaps someone like a friend. Unfortunately, my ornery and taciturn 
      personality precludes this option for me. So I turned to that always 
      reliable source of truth, the internet. To my dismay, it was hard to find what I was looking for:
      succinct, thorough, and reliable guides to different cuisines. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Thus, I decided to be the change I wished to see in the world, and applied this Gandhian 
      spirit to a far, far less noble cause (a website about food...)
      hoping that my example would inspire others to do the same with respect to their own
      cuisines.  
      Thus, I present to you this list, the culmination of my life’s work, 
      an everlasting testament to my mortal existence, or until the money for 
      the domain name and server space run out. I lack much wealth. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="head">
      Author's Credentials
    </h4>

    <p class="main"> 
      Given the ambition of the purpose statement, and to acknowledge the subjectivity 
      inherent in such an undertaking,  I should probably provide my credentials, 
      or lack thereof,  for attempting this. I, the author, and your objective guide, am an ethnic Korean 
      living in the most Korean part of the United States. 
      Hence, I have been around a lot of Koreans and have eaten a lot of Korean food.

      Disclaimers

    <p class="main"> 
      I was not born or raised in Korea, so my lists may be 
      tinted by a diasporic lens. Furthermore, I am not a chef, 
      food critic, scientist, historian, blogger, influencer, etc. My credentials are limited to
      what are stated above, and the fact that I occasionally cook Korean food (to mixed results).
      I never claimed that my credentials were impressive.

      Yes, I know, these dishes are among the most “basic” Korean foods out there. "How much 
      more basic can this be?"
      Well, I call them classics for a reason. They taste good and are frequently eaten. 
      <br> <br>
      Plus, I think starting with these foods provides a good introduction to some of 
      the fundamental ingredients and flavors of Korean cuisine: kimchi, gochujang, gochugaru, 
      doenjang, soy sauce, sesame oil, Korean perilla. The unfamiliar of these items will be explained 
      in the course of the lists. 
      <br> <br>
      So fundamental are these ingredients that some people have gone as far as 
      to say (somewhat condescendingly, I would opine) that all of Korean cuisine is just variations 
      on these core ingredients. Simpletons! Haters! While I acknowledge the rationale behind this 
      profanation, a) it’s not really true, and  b) even if it were 
      true, these ingredients are delicious and there is a lot that one can do with them.
      <br> <br> 
      All this is a digressive way to support the topic sentence of this section; 
      these foods are an enjoyable introduction to the flavors of Korean cuisine,
      and a recommended starting point (although some other good/better stuff awaits). 
      Even if you had only these six Korean foods before you die, regard yourself as having had a life
      well lived. Eat these and you will be able to depart this world in peace.

      Kimchi<br>
      김치
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/kimchi.jpeg">
    <img class="photo" src="Photos/kkakdugi.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Where else to start but with the most famous, quintessential Korean food of them all.
      The standard bearer of Korean cuisine. A word used in too many Korean puns and 
      titles. The unimaginative nickname my high school coach used for me. 
      <br> <br>
      Kimchi is actually not a single dish but rather a class of fermented, usually spicy, 
      vegetable dishes. That’s right, there’s more than one type of kimchi. 
      The most common varieties you will encounter are baechu kimchi (배추김치), made with 
      napa cabbage, (see image on left) and kkakdugi (깍두기), made with radish, see image on right.
      Henceforth, all references to kimchi will be to beachu kimchi. 
      <br> <br> 
      Kimchi is made by seasoning the cabbage with a Korean chili powder 
      called gochugaru (고추가루), gochu (고추) meaning chili pepper and garu (가루) meaning powder. 
      Salt, garlic, and some type of seafood agent, like shrimp or oyster, is also added.  
      <br> <br> 
      Gochu is specifically and always the Korean chili pepper 
      (you know you've made it when you have chili pepper named after you). 
      Gochu is a fundamental and essential ingredient in Korean cuisine, 
      used in many, many dishes. This also means that a lot of Korean food is 
      on the spicier side. Gochu cannot be substituted with other types of chili peppers. 
      I, and others, have tried, and it’s just not the same. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Kimchi is spicy from the chili powder and funky from the other seasonings and 
      fermentation. Younger kimchi still has a vegetable crisp. Older kimchi starts 
      to get soggier and funkier. Some people like it better that way, but I like my 
      kimchi young.  
      <br> <br>
      In my opinion, kimchi’s taste is unique to Korean cuisine and 
      I haven’t been able to find anything quite like it in other cuisines 
      (an assertion which may raise some nationalistic objections, but I have no intention
      of getting into that here).
      <br> <br>
      For some, kimchi is an acquired taste (don’t tell other Koreans, 
      but this was also the case for me). For such people, I can hope that it 
      will start to taste good eventually. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      I must clarify that kimchi, when naked and alone, is not a main dish and 
      is not meant to be eaten by itself. 
      Kimchi by itself is a side dish. You will not see “kimchi” on a menu. 
      Since Koreans eat kimchi with almost every meal, in most Korean restaurants 
      it will be served to you, automatically, as one of many in a fleet of side dishes 
      known as banchan (반찬). Usually, these banchan come free of charge with your main dish 
      (and with free refills too, what a bargain)!
      <br><br>
      Therefore, unless you're really curious, there's no need to go looking for kimchi on its own.
      Just order any (most) of the dishes on the rest of the lists, and you will find kimchi.
      <br><br>
      You can eat kimchi however you want, in between bites of your main meal,
      on the same spoon as your main meal. Whatever you want. 
      The world is your kimchi oyster.
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Deceptively, kimchi is often not vegetarian/vegan, due to the use of 
      seafood agents.
      As such, it’s good to check if you want to be sure. That said, kimchi can be easily
      made vegetarian/vegan simply by excluding any seafood based seasonings and still tastes good. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="head" id="kimchijjigae">
      Kimchi Jjigae<br>
      김치찌개
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/kimchijjigae.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Remember when I said naked kimchi is not a main dish? 
      Here, I now present chaste kimchi, repentant of its debauched ways, 
      fully clothed in the finest adornments. 
      Jjigae (찌개) is one of multiple Korean words for soup type dishes. 
      Jjigae is usually translated as “stew." Hence, this dish is kimchi stew. 
      Soup, stew, honestly, I’m not sure what the difference is, in Korean or in English.
      <br> <br>
      To make kimchi jjigae, one must use old kimchi. Kimchi that is mature.
      Kimchi that is at peace with itself. Young kimchi does not make good kimchi 
      jjigae. It needs to get its life together first.   
      <br> <br> 
      This ripened kimchi is added to a broth, usually animal based. 
      Gochujang and/or gochujang (고추장) are also commonly added. 
      Gochujang is the paste version of Korean chili peppers, and like gochugaru, 
      it’s hard to substitute with other pepper pastes, so don’t try. 
      But wait, you might ask, isn't kimchi already spicy? We need to add more gochu?
      The answer is yes. It must be spicier. 
      <br> <br> 
      Other welcome ingredients are added to the stew depending on the specific recipe. 
      Meat and tofu are the most common invitees. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Hot and spicy, as one might expect. But in a “refreshing” way, as the Koreans 
      like to say. The process of cooking the kimchi mellows out its flavors, 
      and when combined with all the other stuff, is very rich and comforting.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      Like most Korean soups, this is usually eaten with a bowl of rice and banchan. 
      Like the banchan, the bowl of rice often comes automatically if you order kimchi 
      jjigae, but if it doesn’t I would recommend ordering one. 
      Alternate the jjigae with the rice, or have it on the same spoon, 
      whatever floats your boat. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Not if made with animal broth, and the kimchi jjigae usually has meat added. However, 
      this is easy to make vegetarian/vegan and still tastes just as great. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="head" id="doenjang">
      Doenjang Jjigae<br>
      된장찌개
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/dwenjang jjigae.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Many people already know kimchi. But do many people know doenjang (pronounced dwenjang)?
      Doenjang is a more "hardcore" Korean dish. Now we're going deep. 
      Doenjang (된장) is a fermented soy bean paste. As you may have noticed, Koreans love to ferment. 
      Doenjang is not eaten on its own but is used a key ingredient in many dishes, 
      including the titular doenjang jjigae. 
      <br> <br>
      There are many variations of doenjang jjigae, but in its most basic form, 
      the doenjang is boiled in water and meat and tofu are added. 
      Adding gochugaru and chopped peppers (must make it spicier!) is fairly common too. 
      Other ingredients are added based on the specific recipe.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      A stronger, more pungent miso soup might be the best way to describe this. 
      Usually doenjang jjigae is not that spicy, but it can be, depending on the recipe. 
      <br> <br> 
      Based on anecdotal evidence, this dish is hard for a lot of non-Koreans 
      to eat. Apparently it can taste/smell strong or funny. It smells and tastes good 
      to me, but I've also been eating this my entire life. My dear mother makes it 
      all the time. Anyway, if this dish doesn’t do it for you, you will not incur 
      my wrath (only perhaps my mild judgment). At the very least, this is supposed to be healthy.
      Can't go wrong with fermented beans. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      Similar to kimchi jjigae. Recommended, but not necessary, to eat with rice.
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Again, similar to kimchi jjigae, usually no, but easy to veganize and 
      still tastes great. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="head" id="galbi">
      Galbi<br>
      갈비
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/galbi.jpeg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Now we’re getting into the popular stuff. We're veering off Korean creek 
      and entering Main stream. None of this kimchi or doenjang. 
      Meat! Give the people meat! 
      <br> <br>
      Galbi means ribs in Korean, so just saying “galbi” is a actually a little vague and can
      refer to a few different dishes. 
      Most commonly, just “galbi” refers to yangnyeom galbi (양념갈비), yangnyeom meaning marinated, 
      and the ribs being beef. This is opposed to saeng galbi (생갈비), which is boring, 
      non-marinaded beef ribs. Yangnyeom galbi is also sometimes called, even in Korea,  
      LA galbi. LA, of course, referring to a Korean city called Los Angeles. What? Since when is Los Angeles 
      a Korean city? It’s a long story. 
      In short, LA refers to the way that the ribs are cut.   
      <br> <br>
      In summary, just “galbi” usually refers to beef LA yangnyeom galbi. What a mouthful.  
      This is what I’ll be talking about, but another popular version worth mentioning 
      briefly is doeji galbi (돼지갈비), which means pork ribs, and usually uses a spicier marinade. 
      I say all this in case you see all these options on a menu. 
      Why is galbi so complicated?
      <br> <br>
      The marinade used depends on the recipe, but the core ingredients used are soy sauce,
      sesame oil, garlic, and some type of sweetener. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Delicious, soy saucy, sweetish marinated meat. As my friend once said 
      “It doesn’t matter who you are, everyone likes galbi.” 
      This is not true. I have no friends. 
      <br> <br>
      When asked, I used to say that my last meal would be my mom's galbi. 
      However, I later realized the implications this had for order of departure, 
      so I no longer say this, although my love galbi remains. 
      I had classmates in school who mocked me for choosing such an obscure dish 
      as my last meal, but who is laughing now?
      <br> <br>
      Galbi is not spicy. The closest thing I’ve had to galbi is probably Mexican
      carne asada. Honestly, galbi does taste similar to a lot of other marinated
      meat dishes. You can’t go wrong with galbi.
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      Usually with a bowl of rice and banchan. In restaurants, this is often served 
      on a bed of onions. Do not neglect those onions. They are delicious as well. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Very much no. However, I’ve made a vegan “version” by applying the marinate to 
      a vegan receptacle, such a lentils. Still pretty good. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="head" id="bulgogi">
      Bulgogi<br>
      불고기

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/bulgogi.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Galbi’s counterpart and eternal rival in the marinated Korean meat popularity contest. 
      Full disclosure, I am team galbi, hence its preferential treatment on my list, 
      but bulgogi is a winner too. 
      <br> <br>
      This is a similar dish to galbi. The main difference is in the cut of meat used. 
      Bulgogi usually uses a thin cut. Don’t ask me which part of the cow, 
      I just know it’s not the ribs. As far as I’m aware, the basic marinade used 
      for galbi and bulgogi is also pretty much the same. 
      <br> <br>
      Like with galbi, there is some ambiguity with the name. Just “bulgogi” usually refers 
      to the non-spicy beef version. Doeji bulgogi refers to the pork version, 
      which is usually spicier. You may have realized that the pork version of Korean food is always spicier. 
      I don’t know why.  It’s a mystery to me too. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Similar to galbi, mainly with a different texture due to the different cut of meat. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      This can also just be eaten with rice like galbi. Bulgogi comes with more juice, 
      so it is common to mix the bulgogi juice with the rice and eat it that way.
      <br> <br>
      It’s also pretty common to eat bulgogi ssam (쌈) style. Ssam means wrap, and the wrapper in 
      this case is usually one of two leafy vegetables. The first is lettuce, which everyone already
      know. The second is Korean perilla, called kkaennip (깻잎) in Korean.
      <br> <br>
      It's worth briefly discussing Korean perilla, which is used prominently in Korean cuisine,
      and as far as I know, not that prominently in any other cuisine. Korean perilla is used in 
      three main forms: leaf, seed, and oil. In seed form it is also called "wild sesame" (들깨).
      Perilla seeds are one of my favorite things. I have no idea how to describe the taste,
      just give them a try.
      <br><br>
      Back to the main topic, to eat bulgogi ssam, place the meat in the vegetable and add some 
      toppings and condiments, the most common of which are garlic, chili pepper,  
      and ssamjang (쌈장), which is paste with gochujang and doenjang as 
      its main ingredients. The whole packet is then eaten in a single bite.
      I am no dietitian, but I would think that packaging meat in layers of vegetables
      is as arterially friendlier way of eating meat.

      Bibimbap<br>
      비빔밥
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/bibimbab.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Last on the list of classics. Bibimbap just means mixed rice. As that name implies, 
      there are many variations of this dish. In its most basic form, this consists of rice,
      a bunch of different types of cooked and marinated vegetables, meat, fried egg, 
      gochujang, sesame seed and sesame oil  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      A flavor explosion. Each bite has a different marinated vegetable, meat, 
      egg, with the spiciness of the gochujang and the savoriness of the sesame oil. 
      Oddly, I must admit that this has never been a favorite of mine, even though it's really 
      good. But please don't mind my dissent; I'm not even sure what I hope to achieve by mentioning
      it. Bibimbap is a favorite of many people, and at the very least is arguably the single most 
      efficient way of trying different Korean flavors. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      This is usually going to be served unmixed and without any gochujang and sesame oil. 
      Add those to your preference, and then mix it all together. Vigorously. 
      Do not be cute. “Mix” is literally the name of the dish. 
      Mix it all in there before eating. Do not try to eat the parts separately. 
      Presentation is ephemeral, flavor combinations are eternal. 
      <br> <br>
      Also as a general rule of thumb, Korean food has a lot of dishes that involve mixing and 
      combining. Often, it is not mixed for you. Koreans food culture does not coddle the eater.
      When in doubt, feel free to mix your food. 
      <br> <br>
      There is a version called dolsot bibimbap, dolsot (돌솥) referring to the stone bowl this version is 
      served in. In this version, wait a few minutes for the bottom layer of rice to get crispy, 
      like a Persian tahdig, before mixing.   
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      If you exclude the egg and meat. 
      This is very easy to veganize and still tastes great.

      This list is mainly a combination of my personal favorites and dishes that seem 
      to be most popular. I also gave consideration to the uniqueness of the dish. 
      For example, I am not including dumplings or fried rice, which I find to be pretty similar
      across East Asian cuisines. Roughly, these are in order of priority based on the considerations
      listed above.

      감자탕

      Description:
      <br> 
      This is it. This is the number 1 must try. Priority 1. All other priorities rescinded.  
      I can imagine any dish deemed to be a clear number 1 is going to cause some controversy, 
      but I am prepared to defend this decision. In addition to gamjatang being undeniably delicious, 
      this dish is a tour de force of Korean flavors: gochu, doenjang, garlic, 
      and Korean perilla. This dish saw the Korean pantry and took everything. 
      I can't think of anything more intensely Korean. 
      <br><br>
      When I was in college, as the days of dining hall foods turned into weeks, as I was staring 
      out into the endless desert of pizza and salad, gamjatang was the mirage over the horizon. 
      This is what I pined for as I scratched the days on my dorm room wall. It was the singular 
      crystallization of my Korean food longings. Whenever I came home, the first thing I did was
      ignore my family and make an immediate beeline to the gamjatang restaurant.  
      <br><br>  
      Gamja usually means potato and tang is another one of those Korean words for soup.  
      While this dish does include potatoes, in another example of confusing and vaguely named 
      Korean foods, apparently the gamja in gamjatang actually refers to pork neck meat, which is 
      the main meat used. The gamja meat and gamja potato are thrown into a pot. 
      The next step is simple: add every Korean ingredient and flavor known to the Korean people
      and boil. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      A lot of flavors. All those Korean flavors. Everything is in there. Hot and spicy from the gochu, 
      but not super spicy.  Hearty and filling from the doenjang. And then the meat. If done right 
      (it usually is), the meat is super tender and comes right off the bone. 
      Sometimes a dipping sauce is provided for the meat.
      <br><br>
      This dish also feature perilla, which I mentioned before. Sometimes a container of extra
      perilla seed/powder is provided to add. I would add this liberally, but to each their own. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      This can get messy, so don’t be afraid to use your hands to get all the meat out of 
      those vertebrae.  
      <br> <br>
      You can eat this with rice, but usually it isn’t. Ah, because the potatoes are already carby. 
      No, no, no. Gamjatang comes with a bonus dish. It’s a two for one deal. It’s called gamjatang 
      fried rice. If you get the communal version of gamjatang, once you are almost done, 
      save the dregs and some of the soup. The restaurant will use what’s left to make you fried rice. 
      This is also delicious. Gamjatang is the gift that keeps on giving.

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      I don’t know if this is veganizable...but in theory, the soup without the meat would still taste good.

      Naengmyeon<br>
      냉면
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/naengmyun.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      This is a unique tasting Korean dish, perhaps the most unique thing on this list. 
      I’ve haven’t found anything like this. This is also a personal favorite of mine. 
      I love naengmyeon. Hence, it’s number 2 on this list. Naengmyeon just means cold noodle. 
      Another vague name, so let me explain further.
      <br><br>
      Naengmyeon is a noodle dish served in a cold broth. 
      And when I say cold, I mean literally icy cold. Do not be alarmed. This is intentional. 
      This is not (we all presume) someone pulling old broth out of a freezer. 
      <br><br>  
      In its basic form, naengmyeon broth combines dongchimi (동치미), which is a type of non-spicy kimchi, 
      broth (usually beef), and some sweetener. It is usually topped with egg, cucumber, and sesame 
      seed.
      <br><br>  
      Usually/often on a menu you will see two types of naengmyeon, mul naengmyeon (물냉면) and bibim 
      naengmyeon (비빔냉면). If you only see one, mul is the default and is the one I've been talking
      about. Bibim naengmyeon usually has little or none of this broth and instead mixes the noodles in a 
      modified version of gochujang. 
      <br><br> 
      There are some other types of naengmyeon too and all are good, but if it's your first time and
      must choose one, I would choose mul. It’s the more unique and "classic" one.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Cold, needless to say. Not spicy if eating mul naengmyeon, although they sometimes include
      a bit of the bibim sauce. The soup is savory with a bit of sweetness that really goes well 
      with the cold temperature and makes for an incredibly refreshing and satisfying dish. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      I like to slurp up some of the broth as I’m eating this. I usually also drink all my broth 
      once I’m done with the noodles. I like it that much. Naengmyeon also comes with 
      jars or bottles of vinegar and spicy wasabi like mustard to add to taste. 
      I only add a little bit, sometimes none at all, but do as you please. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Unfortunately, it is not. 
      I think there are vegan recipes for this available, but I have not tried any.

      Jjajangmyeon<br>
      짜장면
    </h4>

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Welcome to Korean-Chinese cuisine. Or is it Chinese-Korean cuisine? In either case, this is 
      the Koreanized version of Chinese food. Similar to how spaghetti and meatballs is an American, 
      not Italian dish. This is a complete sub-cuisine of Korean cuisine. 
      <br><br>
      Jjajangmyeon is a black bean noodle dish and is probably the most famous and most representative 
      dish of Korean-Chinese food. It’s another unique tasting dish, although I acknowledge it's 
      uniqueness is impaired a bit by the fact that is derived from the Chinese dish zhajiangmian.
      <br><br>  
      I’ve had both, and they actually taste quite different. The Korean version is sweeter and 
      more watery. So maybe knocking off those uniqueness points was unjustified.
      <br><br>  
      The black bean sauce is made primarily with....Korean black bean paste, also called 
      chunjang (춘장). The “Korean” part here is important. Other cuisines also have a black bean
      paste, but it’s not the same as the Korean one, and that’s where the unique flavor of this
      dish comes from. The chunjang is added with meat and vegetables (lot of onions) and sugar 
      to make the sauce, which is then scooped on top of noodles. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Honestly, I don’t know how to describe this. Beany? I guess? It's a mix of savory and a bit of 
      sweet. Just try it. At the very least, it's something new. It's not the same as the Chinese
      version.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      This is going to come unmixed and uncut. You will be given scissors, or the waiter will offer 
      to cut if for you. Either way, cut the noodles so that they're easier to eat. Then mix the 
      noodles with the sauce and eat.
      <br><br>
      Jjajangmyeon comes with some specific banchan; kimchi, yellow pickled radish, and onion with 
      chunjang dip. Use all of these. They help cut through the greasiness of the jjajangmyeon. 
      <br><br>
      Lastly, a lot of places provide jars of gochugaru if you want to add some heat.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Usually this contains meat, but I’ve seen recipes for vegan versions. 
      I think it would still taste about the same, since my hypothesis 
      is that the chunjang, and not the meat, is the primary flavor component. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="head" id="kimbab">
      Gimbap<br>
      김밥
    </h4>

    <img class="photo" src="Photos/kimbab.jpg">

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Up to this point, I think this list has been moving along without much controversy, but I 
      think adding gimbap here might be the start of some turbulence, which might get worse with my next
      two entries.  
      <br><br>
      I can't claim that gimbap has some amazing flavor, but this dish is the quintessential Korean picnic food, and 
      is a borderline classic. 
      <br><br>      
      Gimbap is part of a class of Korean foods called bunsik (분식), which refers to fast or casual 
      types of Korean foods. Bunsik is also the most common type of Korean street food. 
      <br><br>
      For what it's worth to potential travelers, I don't think street food is a strong part of Korean's 
      food game, especially compared to some other Asian cuisines (looking at you, Taiwan!). Not that 
      Korean street food is bad, just trying to set expectations to prevent disappointment. That 
      said, gimbap is my favorite Korean street food. 
      <br><br>
      Gimbap looks like a Japanese maki roll and is similarly rolled in seaweed, but tastes very 
      different. The rice for gimbap is flavored with sesame oil, not vinegar. 
      And the main ingredients are vegetables, egg, and cooked meat, not raw fish.
      <br><br>
      No gochujang? No seasoning? No spice? Am I sure this tastes good?
      Yes. I don't know how it all works together, but it does.
      You could eat all the ingredients out of a bowl and for some reason it wouldn't taste 
      nearly as good as when it's wrapped in seaweed.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Honestly, not mind blowing. Tastes the way it sounds. 
      Lacks the big flavors of some of the other dishes mentioned so far. But it’s very good in 
      a comforting sort of way. 
      </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      Gimbap is not sushi and is usually not dipped in anything. Also, each piece is eaten as one bite.
      Gimbap is also usually accompanied with a side dish of yellow pickled radish, called danmuji
      (단무지).  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Depends on what’s inside, but very veganizable.

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Ddeokbokki is a dish of rice cakes (usually cylindrical) cooked and coated in a gochujang
      based sauce. Meat and fish cake are also commonly added. Ddeokbokki is also bunsik, and is 
      probably one of the most beloved Korean dishes by the Koreans. If this list was based on a poll
      of Korean, ddeokbokki would probably be higher. 
      <br><br>
      And yet, it is not. Because I am the heretical author of this list, and at the risk of getting 
      my Korean card revoked, I must confess...that I am not a big fan of ddeokbokki.
      I only admit this to provide context for what may sound like a half-hearted description of this
      dish. But know that I am in the minority, ddeokbokki is a Korean favorite. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Taste:
      <br> 
      Spicy! The rice cakes have a chewy texture. The sauce is also savory.  
      </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      How to eat:
      <br> 
      This is usually just eaten by itself. Sometimes you will have option of adding instant ramyeon noodles, 
      in which case the dish becomes rabokki. I like this version better.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Vegetarian/Vegan?:
      <br> 
      Ddeokbokki usually contains meat, but this should be an easy dish to veganize.

      Korean BBQ <br>
      고기
     </h4>
 
     <img class="photo" src="Photos/bbq.jpg">
 
     <p class="main"> 
       Description:
       <br> 
       I imagine some of you may have been wondering why Korean BBQ hadn't shown up yet, given that
       this is arguably the most popular Korean food outside of Korea. I list my reasons
       for it's relatively low placement below: <br>
       1) Korean BBQ is not really a single dish, but more a method of eating meat <br>
       2) I have already mentioned galbi and bulgogi, which fall under the category of 
       Korean BBQ <br>
       3) The most common meats used in Korean BBQ are unmarinated beef brisket and pork belly.
       The keyword here is unmarinated, as in, these meats taste the same as those from anywhere else in the 
       world<br>

       Given point 3, I don't feel like eating Korean BBQ is all that special, or at least, all 
       that Korean. It's just...meat. 
       <br><br>
       I think one's views of this dish come down to how much one likes meat.
       If you do, Korean BBQ is probably great. If you don't, then Korean BBQ is probably not
       a pleasant experience. 
       <br><br>
       As is the case with the previous two items on this list, my tepid description of Korean BBQ 
       may cause some controversy. Mine is probably a minority opinion. Korean BBQ is popular with
       Korean and non-Koreans alike. Koreans often use Korean BBQ for celebrations, so at the 
       very least, Korean BBQ makes for a lively experience.
     </p>
 
     <p class="main"> 
       Taste:
       <br> 
       Depends on what kind of meat you're getting, which marinade, etc. Again, Korean BBQ is not a single 
       dish. 
       </p>
 
     <p class="main"> 
       How to eat:
       <br> 
       If there is a redeeming feature of Korean BBQ, it's that most of the time this is eaten
       using the ssam method, which has been mentioned earlier. This gives a Korean flair to what 
       is otherwise just eating meat.
       <br><br>
       There is a variety of ssam common in Korean BBQ restaurants in the United States
       called ddeokbossam (떡보쌈), which according to my research is a Korean-American innovation. With ddukbossam, rice paper 
       and pickled radish are used to wrap the meat. I am a fan of this innovation. 
       <br><br>
       A lot of Korean BBQ restaurants these days offer all types of meats, premium cuts, creative
       marinades. If that's your thing, by all means enjoy. But as I mentioned before, unmarinated
       beef brisket and pork belly are still the two classic meats, and despite years of trying
       other things, I think those two are still the best. 
       <br><br>
       At the end of the day, there isn't one way to eat Korean BBQ. I think it's a food that 
       increasingly exists as a separate entity belonging to the world, not just to Korean cuisine, 
       so eat it as you wish.

      Honorable Mentions
    </h3>

    <p class="main"> 
      For a variety of reasons, I thought the following did not warrant inclusion in the Classic or 
      Must Try list, mainly due to being redundant or obscure, but were still compelling enough to
      merit a few words.  
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Sundubu (Jjigae) <br>
      순두부 (찌개) 
      <br> 
      This actually might be a good candidate as an introduction to Korean food. 
      Sundubu means soft tofu, and sundubu jjigae (usually just referred to as sundubu)
      is a stew in which soft tofu is added to a broth primarily flavored with gochu garu. 
      I almost included this as a Must Try but didn't because I don't think the flavors are 
      intense enough and there are already a few spicy stews on the list. But this is still really
      good and most sundubu restaurants offer a vegetarian version. 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Budae Jjigae <br>
      부대찌개
      <br> 
      Budae roughly translate to army unit so this is also called army stew in English. Budae jjigae 
      seems to be popular on the internet. It’s like kimchi jjigae but supercharged with a few more 
      unexpected trimmings, such as spam, sausage, and American cheese. A true smorgasbord 
      of processed foods.  
      <br><br>
      Budae jjigae is undeniably good and very flavorful, but I left it out because this is 
      usually only eaten when drinking or drunk, based on anecdotal (personal?) evidence, 
      and I find it too similar to kimchi jjigae, (which I actually prefer, budae jjigae can get 
      a bit salty for me, probably due to all that processed food). 
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Jjamppong <br>
      짬뽕  
      <br> 
      This is a noodle dish in a spicy seafood broth that is also part of Korean-Chinese cuisine.
      In fact, this dish is so inextricably linked to jjajangmyeon that the two might be called the greatest
      rivalry in Korean cuisine. "Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong" is like asking someone "chocolate or vanilla",
      "cheese or pepperoni."
      I didn't include jjamppong because I think it's less unique than jjajangmyeon.
      I also generally excluded seafood dishes from my lists, so I will cover them next.
    </p>

    <p class="main"> 
      Hoe <br>     
      회
      <br> 
      Hoe has a unfortunate romanization which may confuse it with another more vulgar word.
      Hoe is pronounced hwe. Hoe mainly refer to raw fish. Basically, sashimi but Korean style. 
      This is my father’s favorite, and the main difference with Japanese sashimi is that the 
      fish is eaten ssam style with a gochujang based sauce (although the more Japanese style
      soy sauce and wasabi combo in also used).
      <br><br>
      I did not include Korean seafood dishes because I think the more unique flavors of Korean cuisine
      have already been represented. But I would still say that going to a Korean seafood restaurant is 
      worth it to try hoe. While there, also get maeuntang (매운탕) and/or haemultang (해물탕), which are 
      spicy seafood stews and hoedeopbap (회덮밥), which is a Korean style poke bowl (very good). 
      Also good is Korean uni rice (I am ready to say that Koreans use uni better than anyone else).

      Final Remarks
    </h4>

    <p class="main"> 
      Description:
      <br> 
      Obviously, this list is not comprehensive. There are still a lot of really good Korean 
      dishes that I have not mentioned. However, inclusion of more items would make this list too 
      long for its intended purpose. It might already be too long. Curation was needed. 
      <br><br>
      On one hand, I certainly encourage anyone who likes this stuff to look into all the 
      other Korean dishes. On the other hand, my personal opinion is that, for the lay person, 
      everything through the Must Try list is probably enough for a lifetime sampling of Korean 
      cuisine. Unless one plans to become some sort of a Korean food enthusiast, I’m not sure 
      there is a need to go on a deep hunt through the depths of Korean cuisine. I will not judge. 
      There are so many other cuisines to try, and we all have only so much time and stomach space. 
      I can only speak for myself, but I do not intend to sacrifice my svelte figure in order to 
      try every dish conceived by humankind. Mortality forces us to make economical decisions. 
      <br><br>
      That said, if you’ve made it through all of this, thank you for reading. 
      I hope you found it enjoyable and I hope these Korean dishes do not disappoint.
